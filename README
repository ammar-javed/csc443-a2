CSC443 Assignment 2 Fall 2015

Note (For markers):

Some executables output the 

    NUMBER OF RECORDS: 
    NUMBER OF PAGES: 
    Time:

only if the verbose flag [ -v ] is specified at the end of the command. 
That decision was made since it was not specified in the assignment to output
such information everytime the function was run, and was only relevant when we
were doing the experiments.

e.g. csv2heapfile will only putput that information if run like :

./bin/csv2heapfile <csv_file> <heap_file> <page_size> -v
